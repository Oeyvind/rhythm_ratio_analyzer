* markovian player can get stuck if rhythm sequence ends with ratios that does not occur earlier
- add wraparound option? (transition from last to first)
- add "nudge" option? (random change)

* markovian player also could need a "sync to pulse" option, where any rhythm pattern leading to contant offbeats will be "guided" back to downbeats

* rhythm analyzer still makes some mistakes
  - generate definitive test set of rhythms that it must recognize

* vst: 
  - clear should slear display also
  - auto record: 
    - enable record so that it starts recording on the first event received
    - stop recording N secs after last event (can also be manually triggered)
    - restart recording (continue) on next event after "pause"
      - when merging recording segments
        - last event from previous = first event from next phrase
