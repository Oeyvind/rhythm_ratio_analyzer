The max implementation of the rhythm analyzer and generator is organised into a 'source' directory containing max patches and abstractions and any max for live devices in current development, and another directory containing 'frozen' production versions of the max for live devices that are self contained and ready for distribution without any further dependencies. Both the analysis and generator stages are implemented with native Max objects and work without the python back end or other external objects. The pathces still in development might contain additional librarie.

As the implementation relies extensively on the array objects introduced in Max 9, these devices requires Max 9+ and Ableton Live 12+ to work.
The Max for Live device can also be used directly in Max without using Ableton Live.
